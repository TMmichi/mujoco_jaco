        Making proper observations



        Sub-primitives
            Questions:
                1. Why have sub-primitives?
                    - To construct primitives, observation spaces for each should be matched among all.
                        Reason: each primitives shall have an idea with the full knowledge of a current state
                        Question: Doesn't weight network determine how to composite primitives?
                        Defence: 
                    - But there is no need to train each primitives with full observation spaces
                    where they can acheive their goal with much simpler observations.
                    - pretrain sub-primitives with simple observation spaces, and modify them with 
                    full observation placeholders
                
                2. Did X.Peng pretrained their policies with full observation spaces?
                    - ?

            Actions:
                -> Need to select:
                    1. RL-trained sub-primitives and finetune them with full obs space
                    2. Not using sub-primitives and policy transfer with expert data directly with full obs space
            
            Consequences:
                1. if select sub-primitives:
                    Csq: Finetune twice for sub-primitives -> primitives and for primitives -> composite policy
                    Result: Complicated/Time consuming to pretrain and finetune twice
                2. 
            
            Defences for Consequences:
                Def for 1: To avoid complicated / time consumption problem
                    - May not have to finetune for primitives -> composite policies
                    Reason: 
                        1. ?

gripper angle merged into 1
touch sensor improved than the pre-training session


Characteristics at 2069:
    Seems to overfit to a certain trajectory.
    Gripper keep lean over left side no matter where the object is	
    More variance to the gripper angle. It actually changes!
    But still lacks its variance compared to the other actions. Should I also normalize it to 1?
